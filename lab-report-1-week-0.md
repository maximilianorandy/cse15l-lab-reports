*Q1: Add another file to your repository with any name you choose, but end it in the extension .md. Can you use this idea to see that file?*

A1: I can not use this idea to see the file in the website. I later came to the conclusion that when we create a new file we are creating a brand new web page, to see that page we have to link it somewhere.

*Q2: Skim both of those documents, then try to use some of the elements described in the cheat sheet in your index.md file. How do some of the different formatting options show up when you use them? Are any surprising?*

A2: I read both of those documents and tried all of them in the file you can see a scree shot of that below. The different formating options where cool because in the code the words look normal untill you add the different characters which imediatly causes the letters style in the code to change. The most suprising one was the numbered list because you could just do it regularly and it would be the same as the special characters.

*Q3: Which of the following styles works?*

* <mark>[Lab Report 1] (lab-report-1-week-0.html)</mark>
* <mark>[Lab Report 1] (https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-lab-reports-repo>/lab-report-1-week-0.html)</mark>

A3: They both work but the easier one for me was the first one because it was easier to deal with the link.
