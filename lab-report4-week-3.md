# grep -l
Is a command that lists all the names of the files that grep finds what its looking for in...

## Example 1: 
I put `$ grep -l "emergency" technical/*/*.txt` into to the command line for the example below:

```
[cs15lfa22ev@ieng6-201]:docsearch:37$ grep -l "emergency" technical/*/*.txt

```
Above the command `$ grep -l "emergency" technical/*/*.txt` looked for the word "emergency" in the technical directory and it got the information of what files contained it. It printed out the name of many files and within all of them is the word emergency.

## Example 2:
I put `$ grep -l "maximiliano"  plos/*.txt` into to the command line for the example below:

```
[cs15lfa22ev@ieng6-201]:docsearch:44$ grep -l "maximiliano"  plos/*.txt
grep: plos/*.txt: No such file or directory
```
Above the command `$ grep -l "maximiliano"  plos/*.txt` looked for the word "max" in the  plos directory and it turns out that there is not occourance of that string within any of those files. So it returns a statement that says its not in there.

## Example 3:
I put `$ grep -l "emergency" plos/*.txt` into to the command line for the example below:

```
plos/journal.pbio.0020121.txt
plos/journal.pbio.0020263.txt
plos/pmed.0020034.txt
plos/pmed.0020059.txt
plos/pmed.0020065.txt
plos/pmed.0020140.txt
```

Above the command `$ grep -l "emergency" plos/*.txt` looked for the word "emergency" in the plos directory and it outputed the names of files that had the word we where looking for in it. This time there was words in the files that fit the description we where looking for and thats why it does not say no files match it this time.The command `grep -l` is useful to find the files that you are looking for an occurrence of a word. This is better then just using `grep` because without the `-l` it would print the files contents and it would give us a lot of text which would not be useful in helping us know what files contain the string occurrence.

# grep -c

Is a command that returns all the files we looked through, but it also tells us how many occurrences of the word we are looking for is in there...

## Example:
I put `$ grep -c "emergency" technical/*/*.txt` into to the command line for the example below:

The usage of `grep -c` above is helpful to us because it alows us to go through all the files we want to and helps us get the info we want, but it tells us how many times this string appears in each file. The only bad part about this command is that there is a lot of files without it and they just get printed out as well which is ok, but it takes up a lot of space.


# grep -n

Is a command that returns the number of the line that the word can be found on for the file and if the word is not in the file then it will just output the file name with `:0` to say its on 0 lines.

## Example:
I put `$ grep -n  "emergency" technical/*/*.txt` into to the command line for the example below:

technical/911report/chapter-1.txt:74:    About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground.
technical/911report/chapter-1.txt:78:    At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft. Six minutes later, the air traffic control specialist in American's operations center contacted the FAA's Boston Air Traffic Control Center about the flight. The center was already aware of the problem.
technical/911report/chapter-1.txt:88:    At 8:41, Sweeney told Woodward that passengers in coach were under the impression that there was a routine medical emergency in first class. Other flight attendants were busy at duties such as getting medical supplies while Ong and Sweeney were reporting the events.
technical/911report/chapter-1.txt:246:    If a hijack was confirmed, procedures called for the hijack coordinator on duty to contact the Pentagon's National Military Command Center (NMCC) and to ask for a military escort aircraft to follow the flight, report anything unusual, and aid search and rescue in the event of an emergency. The NMCC would then seek approval from the Office of the Secretary of Defense to provide military assistance. If approval was given, the orders would be transmitted down NORAD's chain of command.   
technical/911report/chapter-1.txt:266:FAA Awareness. Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft.
technical/911report/chapter-1.txt:586:The Pentagon Teleconferences. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director for operations immediately thought the second strike was a terrorist attack. The job of the NMCC in such an emergency is to gather the relevant parties and establish the chain of command between the National Command Authority-the president and the secretary of defense- and those who need to carry out their orders.

Above I used `grep -n` and it went through the files we needed to look at and printed the line it can be found on and that specific line in the text, it also listed the files that did not contain it and put a 0 for the line number to say that it doesnt exist in the file. This is helpful for if you want to see where in the text you can find the word you are looking for because you get to know the line number and the words in the line.
