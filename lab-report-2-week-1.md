Lab 2 - Week 1

[Week 1 â€“ Remote Access and the Filesystem](https://ucsd-cse15l-f22.github.io/week/week1/)

So for this lab there was a problem with everyones account and we could not log into our online servers, but my partner reset his password 2 days prior so we where able to do it on his account. As of right now I have tried multiple times an hour to see if it works, but it still does not work. So I will be using my partners screen shots for right now, but when the reset finishes I will change the screen shots. My partner that I worked with in the lab was Rui Li.

This is the text that came out when we got into the servers. The key differences between what we got and the examples from the lab instructions was the numbers in the cluster status. Another detail that was different is that ours did not say `quota: No filesystem specified`. The difference could mean that there is more people on the remote server when we where using it.
