Lab 2 - Week 1

[Week 1 â€“ Remote Access and the Filesystem](https://ucsd-cse15l-f22.github.io/week/week1/)

So for this lab there was a problem with everyones account and we could not log into our online servers, but my partner reset his password 2 days prior so we where able to do it on his account. As of right now I have tried multiple times an hour to see if it works, but it still does not work. So I will be using my partners screen shots for right now, but when the reset finishes I will change the screen shots. My partner that I worked with in the lab was Rui Li.

## Part 4
This is the text that came out when we got into the servers. The key differences between what we got and the examples from the lab instructions was the numbers in the cluster status. Another detail that was different is that ours did not say `quota: No filesystem specified`. The difference could mean that there is more people on the remote server when we where using it.

## Part 5
Me and my partner did the commands that where listed for us to do but out of those the most intresting ones to me where `ls -lat` and `ls -a` and you can see below that they both give the same information of what files are there. The only difference is that `ls -lat` displays all of the files in a long list with each file getting its own line, while for `ls -a` the files are all condenced into a easy to read block with multiple files per line.
