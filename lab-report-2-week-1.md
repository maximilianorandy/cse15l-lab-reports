Lab 2 - Week 1

[Week 1 â€“ Remote Access and the Filesystem](https://ucsd-cse15l-f22.github.io/week/week1/)

So for this lab there was a problem with everyones account and we could not log into our online servers, but my partner reset his password 2 days prior so we where able to do it on his account. As of right now I have tried multiple times an hour to see if it works, but it still does not work. So I will not be using screen shots for my lab report because I can not obtain them.

## Installing VScode
First you will need to download Visual Studio Code on your computer and to do that you should go to this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Once you have downloaded it, then it should look like the picture below.

## Remotely Connecting
Second you will need to connect to the server remotely and to do that we must type in ssh and then press space and then your user name it starts off with `cs15lfa22` then you enter your special two letters then follow it up by typing `@ieng6.ucsd.edu` with no spaces inbetween. Once you do that and press enter you will then be prompted to enter your password which should work when you enter it.

## Trying Some Commands
The third thing you need to do is to enter into the bar different commands for example to enter the `cd` command you are changing the command directory. When you do `ls -a` it prints out a list of the files in a block format and in `ls -lat` it lists the files with one on each line.
